This is a simple project to find Hamiltionian and Euler Cycles in a graph.
The list of edges listed as connections will be transformed:
1) into adjacency matrix to use for undirected_graph
2) into array of successors to use for directed_graph

Both of them will be shown after creating a graph.
Then for each of them there are functions to find hamiltionan and euler cycles.
Program also allows to generate random graphs with the desired density [0-100]% and to read a graph from file (file: data is an example)
In few days, I will also measure times for each of the function to see the difference between both graphs.
